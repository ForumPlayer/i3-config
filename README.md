## i3-config

My i3wm configuration files inspired by Gruvbox colorscheme for Vim. This configuration assumes a fresh install of the i3 community distribution of Manjaro, but might work on other Linux distributions (not tested).

### Requirements

For these configs to work one needs to have the following installed:
- [feh](https://github.com/derf/feh) to set the desktop background.
- [polybar](https://github.com/jaagr/polybar) for the status bar.
- [rofi](https://github.com/DaveDavenport/rofia) as an app launcher and clipboard manager.
- [termite](https://github.com/thestinger/termite), the default terminal application.
- [dunst](https://github.com/dunst-project/dunst) to display notifications.
- [morc_menu](https://github.com/Boruch-Baum/morc_menu) for a simple application menu.
- zsh with [oh-my-zsh](https//github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh) for the default shell.
- [vim](https://github.com/vim) for the default text editor.
- [tmux](https://github.com/tmux/tmux) to create as many terminals as you like.
- [oomox](https://github.com/themix-project/oomox) to generate and edit the theme.

#### Polybar

Polybar is mostly used with builtin modules, but the configuration also includes some custom modules or scripts:
